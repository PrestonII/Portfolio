Once received they had to be converted to a single standard and then have various different versions of it placed across their network. Finding a way to turn the many steps included here into a form of business logic was a challenge but ultimately very profitable for them. Each drawing created could take up to 5 minutes to create manually - they were receiving dozens per day - sometimes, hundreds. ",
