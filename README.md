# A Developer that can also Design Product

Hi, I'm Preston.

I've been working as a dev since 2015 making applications for folks in the AEC (Architectural, Engineering & Construction) industry. I've been lucky enough to work with some exceptionally cool folks over the years to make some really fun stuff. This portfolio showcases some of that work - hope you like it!
